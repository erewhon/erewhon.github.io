      <title>Remaking an online journal</title>

      <description>I have had various online presences for the better part of 20 years. I keep a daily journal, but very few things end up online. I am going to try to write more. Both prose and code. And with time I will probably backfill my other attempts at writing.
Today, I have an old blog at erewhon.flatland.org. I have my business / consulting site at flatland.biz. And who knows what else.</description>

      <description>On this page, I attempt to explain who I am.
My name is Steven Byrnes. See my contacts page if you want to contact me.
Happy? No? Then continue reading dear reader. (Or continue indexing dear Googlebot.)
I have been programming, and working with computers, since the earth cooled. Or at least it seems that way. It’s funny; I usually don’t feel like an old timer. I know a lot of people who have been at it longer than I have, but when I think about it, I started programming (as a kid) almost 30 years ago, I’ve been using Unix &amp;amp; Emacs for close to 25 years, and I’ve been using the Internet for 20 years… Well, that makes me feel like an old timer.</description>

      <description>Gratuitious Complexity [https://theholyjava.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/how-i-learned-to-avoid-magical-dependency-injection-and-love-plain-java/]
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407540/what-are-the-downsides-to-using-dependency-injection]
The same basic problem you often get with object oriented programming, style rules and just about everything else. It&#39;s possible - very common, in fact - to do too much abstraction, and to add too much indirection, and to generally apply good techniques excessively and in the wrong places.  Every pattern or other construct you apply brings complexity. Abstraction and indirection scatter information around, sometimes moving irrelevant detail out of the way, but equally sometimes making it harder to understand exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happening.</description>

      <description>Various presentations I have given, or places I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken. No, nothing earth shattering. But since I present using HTML, might as well dump them here for posterity.
 Bendwood @ Bendwood Elementary (2016-12-12). A friend of my wife&amp;rsquo;s asked if I could talk to her son&amp;rsquo;s computer class. And oh boy did I! (Functional) Reaxtive Web Development @ Houston Functional Meetup (2014-11-19). Clojure @ Clojure Houston Meetup (2013-11-21)? Hadoop for DevOps, including OpenTSDB, Flume, and Scribe @ Houston Hadoop and Spark meetup (2013-04-03) Immutant @ Clojure Houston Meetup (2013-01-24) Cascalog @ Clojure Houston Meetup (2012-12-13)  </description>

      <description>Programming Languages - Lisp Let’s talk about Lisp.
Influenced Smalltalk, Java. Then Lisp borrowed back.
Many years later, Alan Kay suggested that as a result of the confluence of these features, only Smalltalk and Lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object-oriented programming systems.[39]  Edsger W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award lecture said, &amp;ldquo;With a few very basic principles at its foundation, it [LISP] has shown a remarkable stability.</description>

      <description>Programming Principles To be organized…
I was having a hard time sleeping, and my mind started wandering. I’ve been thinking about programming a lot recently, both from the point of view of the process and the product.
As part of reading a lot of things, I’ve been trying to distill some of my thoughts into a variety of rules. (But remember: rules are meant to be broken sometimes.)
 Delivering client value should be first and foremost Clients don’t care about software or technology, they want results Make software accretive</description>

      <description>Small things Sometimes it’s the small things. The wife had bought a YUGE container of grapes, which had barely been eaten. So being Saturday morning, I figured it would be a good time to wash them off. I was going to have some, and put the rest of the washed ones aside. But the kids wanted some too, so the washed grapes went quickly.
I sat down at my computer, wondering if I was “doing it wrong”.</description>
